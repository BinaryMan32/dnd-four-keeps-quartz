Conversation with [[../People/Exanimis|Exanimis]]
- Ask about an audience with the [[../Organizations/Dominion Arcane|Dominion Arcane]]
>	Bring me at least 3 eggs of a giant Queen ant and I can get you an audience with a member of the [[../Organizations/Dominion Arcane|Dominion Arcane]]. Surely they can answer some of your questions. To find a nest, I would suggest checking with the [[Citadel of Griffons|Citadel of Griffons]]. They have a good lay of the land. You'll find them to the northwest of [[Bard's Gate|Bard's Gate]], about four days travel.Â 
- Ask about healing magics
> 	As for healing magics ... all I know is that you can try to draw on what lifeforce already exists within a creature. Surely the Necromancers have devised some way to transmit that lifeforce between creatures. You may have some success in repairing flesh with transmutation magic. If one can turn flesh to stone and stone to flesh, I believe principles should allow the replacement of flesh using non-humanoid components. But I expect that to be a much slower process that would require sustained effort. I would recommend practicing on wounded companions after a battle."
